In order to use this tool you are required to use a custom version of dolphin specificly built for TAS creation called [Dolphin Lua Core](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core).

Once you have downloaded this build, you will need to place the contents of the latest release into the '/sys/scripts/' folder found inside your dolphin lua core install folder.

Once the scripts are in the proper path, open the Dolphin Lua Core Emulator and follow the [Running Scripts](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core#running-scripts) section of the Dolphin Lua Core Github Repository to execute the scripts.
